# Chemistry-Table
A little project I did using C++.
I took a summer chemistry class. 
We had to use the periodic table a lot and I had trouble finding certain elements sometimes.
So I thought, why not make a program where I could just type in the element symbol and it would tell me the details I need
for my intro to chem class?
And.... I did!
With C++ this time, because I was starting to forget how to use C++...

I had to look up somethings I did not learn in my college C++ class, such as how to read a csv file into the program.

Oh, keep in mind the .txt csv might not be 100% accurate. But it seems mostly spot on!
I took this off a website, so....
